### Session Notes 8/24/2024:

The party got a letter from Serissa that said there is an issue with a bunch of giants, that we would be good adventurers to help, etc.. It also told us to meet up with a contact who would teleport us to the beginning of the quest. 

Harbin told us that we would meet our last party member at Gelden Stag Rest. Harbin also gave us a letter to give to the leader of Bryn Shander. 

Iroko's cousin (frost giant), Zephyrus, gave us some starting funds and teleported us to a town called "Bryn Shander". We are to look for "Harshnag" in the city for additional help once we get into the city. 

The city that we teleported to is the largest of the towns in the area. It is widely regarded for its thriving trading markets. The city is also known for having big walls and sturdy foritfications. There are three entrances into the town. 

We met with the deputy sherrif of the city at the gates. We told her that we were sent with a note of condolences for the death of the sherrif's sister. The deputy sherrif did not know that they had fallen in battle. The sherrif let us in the south west gate. 

The party decided to go find the sherrif so that we can deliver the news of his late sister. We informed the sherrif about the death of his sister, and that we don't know much about the circumstances of her death. The sherrif was heartbroken. The sherrif also recommended going to Gelden Stag Rest for a decent night's sleep. 

We went to the Gelden Stag for accomodations. We got two rooms. We decided to commit mail fraud and open the letter that Harbin gave us for the town's leader, Dartha Sherell. Faethana used slight of hand to open the evnelope without breaking the seal. The letter said that the town's leader isn't doing a very good job, that there's too many orcs around, and generally that Dartha is doing a shit job. 


### Summary: 

The party embarked on a new adventure after receiving a letter from the frost giant Serissa, who sought their assistance in dealing with a giant-related crisis. Following Serissa's instructions, they met with Harbin Wester, the leader of Phaldin, who provided them with crucial information about their final party member and a sealed letter addressed to the leader of Bryn Shander. With a generous sum of starting funds and a magical teleport from Iroko's cousin Zephyrus, the party found themselves in Bryn Shander, a bustling town renowned for its trade and fortified walls.

Their first act in Bryn Shander was to locate the sheriff and deliver the somber news of his sister's demise. The sheriff, devastated by the loss, suggested they seek rest at the Gelden Stag Rest. The party took his advice and secured accommodations at the inn.

Curiosity piqued, they decided to open the sealed letter from Harbin. Using Faethana's nimble fingers, they carefully opened the envelope without breaking the seal. The letter's contents painted a bleak picture of Bryn Shander's leadership, criticizing Dartha Sherell's incompetence and the town's struggles with an overwhelming orc population.
